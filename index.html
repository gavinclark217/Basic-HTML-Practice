    <h1>I am a human being</h1>
    <h3>I think</h3>
    <p>I take a lot of pictures of the sky. Sadly I live in the city so the light pollution 
        is pretty bad compared to places like my grandparents who are like 45 minutes away. 
        It really makes a big difference.</p>
    <h4>Here's a list of the gear I use to take pictures</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Canon 6D</li>
        <li>Rokinon 135mm f/2 prime lens</li>
        <li>Canon 28-70mm f/2 zoom lens</li>
        <li>Sky-Watcher Star Adventurer 2i</li>
        <li>Orion Skyquest XT8</li>
        <li>Celestron Powerseeker 127EQ
            <ul>
                <li>This was my old telescope, I still sometimes use it for visual as it's a lot 
                    more portable but the dob is a million times better for astrophotography.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Random intervalometer I found on Amazon</li>
        <li>Laptop and iPad</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps to begin DSO imaging session</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Find a target to capture</li>
        <li>Set your camera settings to where you want them to be
            <ul>
                <li>What will your exposure length be? ISO? Aperture? How long are you planning to be out?</li>
                <li>It is <strong>very</strong> important that you capture in RAW format, <strong>not</strong> jpg!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Set camera up on equatorial mount outside</li>
        <li>Point tracker North towards Polaris (North Star) if you're in the Northern hemisphere 
            to polar align. If you're in the Southern hemisphere, point your tracker towards Octans 
            (this is where the South Celestial Pole is)
            <ul>
                <li>Polar alignment can take a while, don't rush it or else your stars will be trailed!</li>
                <li>Not all mounts require absolutely perfect polar alignment, things like guidescopes 
                    used for autoguiding can help get more accurate tracking without having your polar 
                    alignment perfect.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Without messing up your alignment, point your camera towards your target</li>
        <li></li>
    </ol>
